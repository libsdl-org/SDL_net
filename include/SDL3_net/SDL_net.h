 * problems in transmission, the system will deal with protocol negotiation
 * and retransmission as necessary, transparent to your app, but this means
 * until data is available in the order sent, the remote side will not get any
 * new data. This is the tradeoff vs datagram sockets, where data can arrive
 * in any order, or not arrive at all, without waiting, but the sender will
 * not know.

 * Create and bind a new datagram socket.

 * Datagram sockets follow different rules than stream sockets. They are not a
 * reliable stream of bytes but rather packets, they are not limited to
 * talking to a single other remote system, they do not maintain a single
 * "connection" that can be dropped, and they more nimble about network
 * failures at the expense of being more complex to use. What makes sense for
 * your app depends entirely on what your app is trying to accomplish.
 *
 * Generally the idea of a datagram socket is that you send data one chunk
 * ("packet") at a time to any address you want, and it arrives whenever it
 * gets there, even if later packets get there first, and maybe it doesn't get
 * there at all, and you don't know when anything of this happens by default.
 *
 * This function creates a new datagram socket.
 *
 * This function does not block, and is not asynchronous, as the system can
 * decide immediately if it can create a socket or not. If this returns
 * success, you can immediately start talking to the network.
 *
 * You can specify an address to listen for connections on; this address must
 * be local to the system, and probably one returned by
 * SDLNet_GetLocalAddresses(), but almost always you just want to specify NULL
 * here, to listen on any address available to the app.
 *
 * If you need to bind to a specific port (like a server), you should specify
 * it in the `port` argument; datagram servers should do this, so they can be
 * reached at a well-known port. If you only plan to initiate communications
 * (like a client), you should specify 0 and let the system pick an unused
 * port. Only one process can bind to a specific port at a time, so if you
 * aren't acting as a server, you should choose 0. Datagram sockets can send
 * individual packets to any port, so this just declares where data will
 * arrive for your socket.
 *
 * Datagram sockets don't employ any protocol (above the UDP level), so they
 * can talk to apps that aren't using SDL_net, but if you want to speak any
 * protocol beyond arbitrary packets of bytes, such as WebRTC, you'll have to
 * implement that yourself on top of the stream socket.
 *

 * you do not have to byteswap it into "network order," as the library will
 * handle that for you.
